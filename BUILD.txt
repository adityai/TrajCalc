Required libraries:
  * PyKEP http://esa.github.io/pykep/
  * PyGMO http://esa.github.io/pygmo/
  * Boost

Only C++ parts of PyKEP and PyGMO are needed.

Compiler with C++1y support is required (GCC 4.9 or above).

PyKEP and PyGMO have not configured for building with Visual Studio, so MinGW in needed for building for Windows.
